# Tiny Habits
## 1. Your takeaways from the video.
- The speaker says starting with a small habit is easier than making a big change because the former requires less motivation and willpower. By starting with a tiny habit, we can create a positive feedback loop that makes it easier to form new, healthier habits.

- Fogg suggests starting with something that takes less than 30 seconds to do, such as doing two pushups or drinking a glass of water. By making the habit easy, we remove the barrier to entry and increase the likelihood of sticking to it.

- The speaker emphasizes the importance of celebrating small wins to create positive momentum. By celebrating each time we complete our tiny habit, we reinforce the behavior and make it more likely to stick.

- Fogg suggests that we can make new habits stick by "stacking" them onto existing habits. For example, if we want to start flossing our teeth every day, we can stack it onto our existing habit of brushing our teeth. This makes it easier to remember and more likely to become a habit.

- Finally, Fogg argues that we need to change our mindset about behavior change. Instead of focusing on willpower and motivation, we should focus on designing our environment and behaviors to make the habits we want to form easier to do. By making small, sustainable changes to our habits, we can achieve significant results over time.

## 2. Your takeaways from the video in as much detail as possible.
- The video discusses BJ Fogg's Tiny Habits method for developing a new habit, which involves three steps: shrink, action prompts, and shine.

- The Tiny Habits method uses a formula called "B=MAP" (Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt) to explain how human behavior works.

- To develop a new habit, it's important to find the tiniest possible version of the behavior to make it easy to do and require very little motivation.

- Action prompts are used as triggers to perform a new habit. They involve completing one behavior and using that momentum to start a new one.

- Shine involves celebrating and reinforcing new habits to make them stick. It's important to acknowledge the progress made and build on the momentum.

- The Tiny Habits method can be used to develop a wide range of habits, from reading before bed to working out more. The key is to start small, find action prompts, and celebrate progress.

## 3. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier?
We can use B = MAP formula to make creating new habits easier by breaking down the process into three parts:
- Motivation: Identify the motivation behind the habit we want to create. Why do we want to do this habit? What benefits will it bring? Make sure our motivation is strong enough to help you overcome any challenges that may come up.

- Ability: Make the habit as easy as possible. This means breaking it down into smaller, manageable steps. BJ Fogg suggests finding the tiniest version of your desired habit that we can do in 30 seconds or less. By making the habit easy to do, we won't need a lot of motivation to get started.

- Prompt: Use a prompt to remind you to do the habit. This can be an external prompt like an alarm or notification, an internal prompt like a feeling or thought, or an action prompt where the completion of one behavior triggers the start of another. Use an action prompt whenever possible, as it is the most effective.

## 4. Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?
- Celebrating our success provides positive reinforcement, which strengthens the neural pathways associated with the habit we're trying to form. When we celebrate, our brain releases dopamine, a feel-good chemical that reinforces the behavior and makes it more likely that you'll repeat it.

- Celebrating our success can be a powerful motivator to keep going. When we celebrate, we feel good about ourselves and our progress, which can give us the energy and motivation we need to keep going.

- Celebrating our success can help build our self-confidence. Each time we complete a habit, we prove to ourselves that we're capable of making positive changes in our life. This can help build our self-esteem and give us the confidence we need to tackle bigger challenges.

## 5. Your takeaways from the video.
- According to James Clear, our daily habits and routines are the building blocks of our long-term success. By focusing on small, incremental improvements each day, we can achieve significant results over time.

- Clear emphasized the power of compounding, which means that small improvements over time can lead to exponential growth. Just as money grows through compound interest, our skills and abilities can also improve through consistent effort.

- James Clear advised the audience to focus on the process of improving, rather than solely on the outcome. By emphasizing the process, we can create sustainable habits and avoid the temptation to give up when we don't see immediate results.

- According to Clear, failure is a natural part of the improvement process, and we should view it as an opportunity to learn and grow. By embracing failure and learning from our mistakes, we can continue to improve and make progress over time.

- Clear encouraged the audience to take action and start making small changes right away. By taking action, we can create momentum and begin to see the benefits of consistent improvement in our lives.

## 6. Write about the book's perspective on habit formation from the lens of Identity, processes and outcomes?

Clear's approach to habit formation is based on the idea that identity, processes, and outcomes are all important components of building good habits and breaking bad ones. By focusing on becoming the type of person who embodies the habits we want to adopt, creating systems that make it easy to engage in good habits, and setting specific goals and measuring our progress, we can make lasting changes in our lives.

## 7. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a good habit easier?

James Clear suggests some strategies to make a good habit easier such as:

- One way to make a good habit easier is to reduce the friction involved in performing the habit.
- Another way to make a good habit easier is to make it more convenient.
- Using habit stacking involves linking a new habit to an existing habit that you already do consistently.
- Clear emphasizes the importance of starting small when building new habits. Rather than trying to make big changes all at once, start with a small, manageable habit and gradually increase it over time.
- Clear suggests using visual cues to make good habits easier. For example, if you want to drink more water throughout the day, you could keep a water bottle on your desk as a visual reminder to drink water regularly.

## 8. Write about the book's perspective on making a bad habit more difficult?

- One way to make a bad habit more difficult is to increase the effort required to perform it.
- Our environment can have a big impact on our habits. Changing your environment can make it more difficult to engage in a bad habit.
- A visual reminder can help to reinforce the good habit and make the bad habit more difficult to perform.
- A commitment device is a strategy that makes it harder to engage in a bad habit by committing to a penalty if you do.
- Sharing your goals and progress with others can help to hold you accountable and make the bad habit more difficult to perform.

## 9. Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
Let's take I want to develop a habit of going for a morning walk every day. The steps I am going to take are:

- Set out my walking shoes and clothes the night before so that they are visible and easily accessible. This will make it easier to get started with your morning walk.
- Choose a scenic route for my morning walk that I enjoy and find visually appealing. I can also listen to music or an audiobook while walking to make it more enjoyable.
- Start with a short walk that I can comfortably manage and gradually increase the duration and intensity over time.
- I can also find a walking buddy or join a walking group to make it more social and enjoyable.

## 10. Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

Here are some steps I can take to make the habit less attractive and harder to follow:

- Remove unhealthy snacks from my pantry or kitchen and replace them with healthier alternatives such as fruits or nuts.
- Make the unhealthy snacks unappealing by adding a bad taste to them or placing them in an unappetizing container.
- Increase the effort required to snack on unhealthy foods by storing them in a place that's harder to reach or access, such as a high shelf or a cupboard that requires a stool to reach.
- Associate the act of snacking on unhealthy foods with negative consequences such as feeling guilty or bloated.
- I can also replace the habit with a healthier and more satisfying alternative, such as drinking a cup of herbal tea or reading a book.
