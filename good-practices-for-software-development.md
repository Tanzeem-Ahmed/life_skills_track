# Good Practices for Software Development

## 1. What is your one major takeaway from each one of the sections?
- Always take notes during meetings as we won't remember everything that was discussed in the meeting. Ask questions so that we get more clarity about the task. Share the notes with the team so that everyone will be on the same page and finally get frequent feedback during implementation.

- If the task cannot be completed on the given deadline due to any particular issue then inform the relevant team and get a new deadline. We don't have to use private DM's, try to inform the issue in a group chat or channels. We have to take calls from the team and if we can't take the call immediately then receive the call and inform them you will call back in 5-10 min, and call them back.
  
- If we are stuck anywhere then ask questions and the question should be very clear to the other person so that he gets more clarity on the problem. Try to mention the solution which we have tried to fix the problem.

- Join meetings 5-10 mins early so that we can get to know about team members which will help in communication with the team.

- Whenever there is no possibility of getting a call with team members try to message them on WhatsApp or Slack and address all the questions that we have at once.

- Always focus on what we are doing, work when we work and play when we play. Keep all the distractions away while working. do some exercise to keep your energy levels high throughout the day.

## 2. Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

- Communication with team members is the area that I need to improve especially while remote work. 

- Try to join meetings early or communicate with team members during meetings so that will get to know about them. 

- Making time for the product on which I am working and for the relevant team.

- Try to connect on whatsapp or slack when stuck.
