## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

No one in the work place deserves to be sexually harassed or bullied. To start with, first we should know the policies and procedures against sexual harassment and bullying of the company. Then try to make a document of everything which will be helping in remember the offender name and incidents. 

Similarly, we can save evidence which will help with our complaint. for instance,  we can have evidence of text messages, photos or emails.

Further, try to connect with other employees to get information and advice from them who are going to help us to file a lawsuit. Similarly, never we should never deal it with our own or we should not tell about it to someone whom we trust as well.

For this incidents we have to involve HR and manager who will be helping us to resolve the matter.
