# Learning Process
## 1. Feynman Technique

This technique is named after a great scientist Richard Feynman. He won a Nobel prize for his work in quantum electrodynamics in the year 1965. He was also known for his teaching skills and understanding the concepts with clearity. That is the reason this techinque is named after him. Basically explaining a concept to other person helps in understanding the concepts in much more depth be it any area. 

As Feynman himself said **"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool"** which means to get good hold in any concept is to explain it to someone else.

### Benefits of Feynman Technique

1. Going through the concepts quickly as it provides overview of the concept and see where our knowledge is strong.
2. It helps in pin pointing an area instantly in which we are not strong and where we need to put more efforts.

## 2. Different ways to implement Feynman technique

The process includes 4 steps as follows: 
1. First step is to write down the concept name in a paper.
2. Write the content of the concept in a simple language so that even a person who is new to the concept should understands it.
3. Note down the areas in which we are stuck or not able to explain it in a simple language and work on them.
4. Note down the technical terms and try to explain it in a simple language that is plain English.

For example, we have a Pythogorean theorem if someone ask a formula it's very basic formula so everyone will tell that as it hold true for all right traingles. But when asked how does it works so we might not be able to answer or we have to do lot of math to figure out. So here comes we have to learn about the concept in depth.

### Paraphrase

In this TED talk Barbara shares her experience about her journey in becomming a professor of engineering. As a child she was only loved to learn languages and also she learned Russian language while she was working with military. At the age of 26 she decided to change her brain which was not easy because of the learning process then was not so good.

She began reaching top professors who are expert in their areas and also they can teach effectively. She found that it's the same way how she teach and learn. After doing all this research she found the keys of learning effectively.

As we know, our brain is complex but we can make it simple by two modes. The first one is the focus mode which is like let's say when we look at something immediately we shift all our attention to that thing. The other mode is diffuse mode which is a relaxed set of neural states.

When we try to learn something we try to go back and forth between these modes. For example, when we learn a new concept or we try to solve a problem in which we are stuck then we try to turn our attention away from that concept and allow diffuse mode to do their work in the background.

For learning the topics with good focus we can follow pomodoro technique which is 25 minutes of learning and few minutes of relaxing. Relaxing is the important part in our learning process. All we have to do is not to focus on completing the task we have to keep in mind that we have to be focus in these 25 minutes. 

Many students learn slow and put lot of efforts to learn something. That is because they don't know how to learn effectively. Some people says understanding the concepts is enough but that is not true. With  understanding we have to practice and repeat the topics in order to remember the concepts.

## Some of the steps which we can take in our learning process

1. We can do exercise as researchers says it will help in increasing our ability in learning and remembering the concepts.
2. We can test our knowledge by by giving tests or practicing the concepts which will help to know where we are lacking.
3. We can implement pomodoro technique in our learning process to learn topics more effectively.
4. We can explain to other person about the concept which will help in knowing how good we are in that particular concept.

### Paraphrase

In this TED talk Josh Kaufman shares how to learn anything with certain techniques. Josh researched about in how much time one can learn new thing and he found that it is going to take him thousands of hours. This ten thousand hours rule was originated by a professor in Florida university who name is K. Anders Ericson. The take from the ten thousand rule is it will take 10,000 hours to get to the top or expert of any competitive field in a subject.

Further, when we start to learn anything new to them it will take time to learn it. But with little practice it will become easier and it will consume less time to learn. Josh research says it takes around 20 hours to learn new topic which includes focus and learn effectively. The process as follows below.

### 1. Deconstruct the skills

We have to decide what we want to do after we are done and then look into skill and break it down into smaller and smaller pieces. The more we break the concept into pieces the more we will be able to get what we want.

### 2. Learn enough to self-correct

We can get three to five resources about what we want to learn. We can learn just enough so that we can evaluate ourself that where we stand.

### 3. Remove Barriers to practice

we have to remove distraction while we are learning in order to be much more focus on what we are learning.

### 4. Practice atleast 20 hours

We can practice daily 45 minutes in a day the concept with full focussed for 20 hours.

## Some of the steps we are going to take when we learn new topic

1. Know what we want to learn from the topic and collect few resources about that topic.
2. Break down the topic into few subtopics which will help in learning in a structured way. 
3. Give proper focus during the time which we decide to learn and remove all the distraction during that time such as mobiles, tv etc.
4. After learning new sub topics practice it daily to get a good hold on the topics.
